    "There are several factors that can influence a student's performance on a test, but for the sake of this analogy, let's consider the number of hours spent studying as a key determinant. In this scenario, the student's performance on the test is the 'dependent' variable, which is influenced by the 'independent' variable of hours studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if Student One achieved a perfect score of 100% after dedicating 10 hours to studying, and Student Two attained a score of 50% after studying for 5 hours, what might Student Three score after studying for 7 hours? If you guessed 70%, you're correct.\n",

    "In the language of data analysis, predicting the outcome of one variable based on another is termed linear regression analysis."
